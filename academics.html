As a young boy, I was bombarded with messages affirming societies obsession with toxic masculinity and I never understood it, why were my mannerisms being challenged? Why were teachers expectations of behavior gendered? Many moments taught me my desired self-expression was not the norm, one of which was when I was seven. It was one of the first days of first grade and the class was drawing with markers, when I decided that my nails looked better with blue marker on them. After all ten nails appeared to my liking, my teacher took me to the bathroom and said, ‘Why would you do that, what's wrong with you,’ while putting my hands under the cold water, ‘You can’t go home like this, you know better.’ Looking back she was the one who knew better even though she couldn’t have known the effect that it had on me. I was given so many messages in that moment, the most damaging was the idea that I shouldn’t go home with blue nails, that my family would judge me and that the school would be to blame for my behavior. Unfortunately, similar comments from the teacher continued, many of which we tagged along with her implicit gender bias. ‘Why aren’t you playing with the boys’ and making comments about my voice, telling me to ‘talk right’ because I was young and I had the gay dialect. Indirectly, I was told that my behavior was not masculine enough and that was on top of the standard of heteronormativity, it felt like constant decisions were being made about who I was supposed to be. By age eight always on five different sports teams, my parents would tell me, ‘Let's try a wide range of activities to see what you like’ and it sounds like great parenting on paper, but my reality was a bombardment activities that I despised. From age eight to fifteen I tried Baseball, Hockey, Soccer, Fencing, Tennis, Squash, Lacrosse, and Cross Country. I was quiet and rarely voiced my opinion at home, so a system of sport by sport trial and error continued, it took a long time for me to understand the effect it had on me but what I felt in those moments were intense sadness and loneliness. I felt so out of control and was afraid of confrontation, something was frequent at home, this allowed for my parents let toxic masculinity control the decisions they made for me, they would tell me what my interests were, they told me how to act in their world and I listened to all of it; I convinced myself that this how I was to act and that anything else was unacceptable, I was not showing emotion in front of others, I was to engage in masculine activities and enjoy them, and I was too physically present as similar if not identical to my father. I was afraid of being different, and I hadn’t met anyone who I felt represented how I wanted to express myself until I was twelve and was like everything fell into place. Watching men and women break off from gender norms allowed me to learn about who I wanted to be and helped me gain confidence in who I was, even today I still write notes to myself in an attempt to challenge narratives that have been forced on me, recently I found a journal entry that was titled, I am enough, I am everything that I want to be. I still struggle with self-confidence but I always try to remember that my presence is not a threat to anyone specifically but a threat to a system of gender roles and dynamics.
I was Recently I was on the subway, crying, and a kid (around ten) was staring at me, his eyes did not convey empathy rather he looked surprised or shocked, how could a man show emotion in public? How could you let strangers watching you be so vulnerable? He reminded me of the ten-year-old who told not to cry, not to throw like a girl, walk like a girl, talk like a girl and dress like a girl, I was glad that he had to watch me cry my way to west fourth street, I wish that I could have seen more vulnerable men at that point in my life, and I immediately thought, what impact that would have had on ten year me? I realized that the journey that I went on of self-discovery, everyone goes through, as children, we fit molds shaped by parents, teachers, and peers, and we all have to break the mold to understand who we want to be.

<h3>My Infrared Study</h3></a></button>
<div class="infaoverflow">
As a student I wanted to intersect two classes 
I have taken so in my free time I have been 
researching about infrared light as part of a 
long  term  project  where I take infrared  photos. 
This project helped me understand the science behind 
micro wavelengths and how that most  light is invisble 
to the  naked eye. Infrared  film also caused extended  
learning for me because I discovered the film was invented  
to take aeral  photographs of deforestation.
<hr>
this diagram shows all the types of light. 
Infrared light is just above 700  wavelengths
and

this is an image I took. This image was taken 
while the leaves where changing so some  of the 
foliage is white while some of it is not. Aerial 
Photographers  used this film so that trees would be 
highlighted more easily.

<h3>My Coding Skills</h3>

As a high  school student I wanted to learn skills<br>
that I can apply to the modern workforce. As the youngest <br>
sibling in my family I have  noticed my sisters wish <br>
they learned skills compatible with website development, <br>
design,and computer science. Here are some of my first <br>
